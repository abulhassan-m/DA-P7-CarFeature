## Project Overview
### Introduction
This project aims to analyze how various car features influence their pricing and profitability. By examining a dataset of car models and their specifications, we provide actionable insights for car manufacturers to optimize pricing strategies and product development.
Problem Statement
The automotive industry is evolving rapidly, with a focus on fuel efficiency, environmental sustainability, and technological innovation. This project addresses how a car manufacturer can optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand.
### Dataset
-	Title: Car Features and MSRP
-	Source: Kaggle
-	Description: Contains information on car models, specifications, and MSRP.
- Variables: Make, Model, Year, Engine Fuel Type, Engine HP, Engine Cylinders, Transmission Type, Driven Wheels, Number of Doors, Market Category, Vehicle Size, Vehicle Style, Highway MPG, City MPG, Popularity, MSRP.
### Key Insights
- Popularity varies by market category, with luxury and performance cars being more popular.
-	Engine horsepower has a positive correlation with car price.
-	Key determinants of car pricing include engine horsepower, vehicle size, and market category.
-	Average car prices differ significantly across manufacturers.
-	Fuel efficiency is generally better in cars with fewer engine cylinders.
### Deliverables
-	Interactive Dashboard: Provides insights into car features, pricing, and profitability.
-	Project Report: Detailed documentation of the analysis and findings.
-	Presentation: PowerPoint slides summarizing key insights and recommendations.
